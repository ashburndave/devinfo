# this Android project .gitignore was created using the sample on the web page:
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore
# ... but I decided that I wanted to keep .classpath and .project in the git repo

# built application files
*.apk
*.ap_

# files for the dex VM
*.dex

# Java class files
*.class

# generated files
bin/
gen/

# Local configuration file (sdk path, etc)
local.properties

# Eclipse project files
# .classpath
# .project

# Proguard folder generated by Eclipse
proguard/

# Intellij project files
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws
.idea/
